to compile a shared lib:
`make gameboy.so`
then run the front end from python
`python mario.py`
`python space.py`
`python prince.py`

alternatively, build a standalone gameboy with GLFW support and play games manually
i.e.
`./gameboy ./roms/games/pacman.gb`

```
enter - START
space - SELECT
Z     - A
X     - B
+ arrows (left, right, down, up)
```
